// Ensure that your Tailwind CSS configuration is correctly set up and that the build process correctly includes the necessary CSS.
// For example, check your `tailwind.config.js` file to confirm the correct content and paths are set.
// Check your build script or process to ensure the Tailwind CSS directives are correctly compiled.
// Also, make sure you have imported the Tailwind directives correctly into your CSS file.
// If using a build tool, check if postcss and autoprefixer are set up and working.
// Verify that the necessary plugins are installed and added in the `tailwind.config.js` file.
// Sometimes the problem is as simple as a missing or incorrect import, missing the build step, or an error in your configuration file.
